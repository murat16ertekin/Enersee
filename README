Enersee is an E-Energy Java application created in 2011 for Center for Digital Technology and Management (CDTM) at the Technical University of Munich (TUM). The purpose of the application is to measure the amount of energy a device is using and create a visual for the user of energy usage over a period of time. This visual will allow the user to make smart decisions on how to reduce energy usage in the home and lower monthly costs.
